And, I'm curious to see if mulching, green mulching, etc— in combination with no-till methods— will improve soil moisture levels even without regular irrigation. Our fields are fairly wet, and most of the plots have been in no-till for three years now and seem to do a fairly good job retaining moisture under normal circumstances. The perennial crops do fine, but I do know that during prolonged periods without rainfall, the yields of annual crops will be improved by irrigation.",It helps the farm be more resilient (a founding farm goal) and it can improve outputs.,,,,,Very knowledgeable,Somewhat knowledgeable,Somewhat knowledgeable,Somewhat knowledgeable,Somewhat knowledgeable,Very knowledgeable,Very knowledgeable,Somewhat knowledgeable,Somewhat knowledgeable,Very knowledgeable,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,,,5,2,4,2,"It felt like this was an important grounding for everyone to have in the climate science and shared assumptions, and I was really grateful that this depth of science was presented in such a clear way from the beginning. It feels essential to the task at hand that people understand the science (and that we agree on the science). I know that there was some negative feedback expressed about this session on this first day, but I would really strongly encourage you to keep it in the curriculum. That being said, I wonder if we could have watched this session alone on our own time instead of using valuable group time to do it. Or watched some of it on our own and then had half of the class time to discuss it. There are two things that I really felt were missing from the facilitation of the week, and one was a setting of community guidelines around conversation. (i.e. things like ""take space, give space;"" ""assume best intentions,"" etc.) I know that this can feel hokey to do in more academic spaces, but I find that if there hasn't been an expectation set around making space for people to speak who might not normally get the chance, groups automatically replicate systems of power in which older white, cis men take well over the majority of space in a conversation, and everyone else listens. I definitely observed that happening in this group, so that I, as a younger, quieter, female person felt that it was harder to participate (out loud) and also felt really really curious about what other perspectives we had in the group who also weren't finding space to speak. This is the kind of thing that I think it might have been helpful to talk about in a first (mandatory) session. The other thing that I was really hungry for were more whole-group discussions. Spending less time in session on this piece might have created more space later for group-wide discussion. ",This was great and I really appreciated Joshua as a presenter.,"This is a place where I actually really wanted to know what kind of knowledge was already in the room. Art did a great job at laying out possible tools for adaptation, but I know that many farmers in the room have probably already been using these tools for over a decade. The session felt a little remedial and a little too broad to be helpful. When farmers stayed afterwards on the call, they were able to share a lot more specific tools and ideas that were much more helpful. I left the week wishing that there was a lot more time for this kind of cross-pollination when we were altogether. Don't underestimate how much farmers know and have already been doing and what they have to teach each other.

I also feel like everyone's crazy uncle saying this, but I felt like the adaptation strategies were a little narrow and felt well within convention in organic agriculture. I believe that irrigation, plastics, etc. will be important pieces of our toolbox going forward, but I also believe that more tools and more systemic changes will be needed to successfully adapting to climate change. I'm thinking about things like transitioning to growing more perennial crops, selecting crops based on resilience, doing education work with customers around how we might change what/how we eat in order to be more adaptive as the climate continues to change.","I loved the science here and appreciated the realism in the presentation. There's so much hype around carbon sequestration, and it was really good see that some of this hype is conjecture and to learn that I had some assumptions/beliefs around sequestration that actually didn't have much scientific backing. The presenters made a lot of space for discussion, which was amazing, AND there were so many questions that I left with based on this discussion and the discussion in the chat(especially around forestation, key-lining, agroforestry). ","Loved this. Super helpful, super relevant and often not taught. Conversation and conflict are skills that we all have to be working on! My biggest take-away is that we can use images to make future possibilities more understandable. ","As far as I could tell, there was only one person of color in the workshop and (I'm making an assumption) no presenters who were indigenous and people of color. I know that farmers in the Northeast are mostly a white group, and that this probably represented the applicant pool, so it's not a criticism of you. That being said, I come from a more social science/activism background, and I think that there's a lot of good reason to believe that adapting to climate change is going to require a societal shift towards empowering indigenous peoples, listening to their knowledge, and adopting their values. I'd love to see some of this perspective incorporated somehow, even if it's just in reading a chapter of Braiding Sweetgrass, written by indigenous biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer. Science and farming don't exist within a vacuum, and I think we do ourselves a disservice not to (gently) address the social context in which we operate. ",Very interested,Maybe interested,Very interested,Not interested,Very interested,Very interested,conversations around more systemic adaptations and social contexts,Breeding and choosing crops/varieties for more resilience; seed saving and storing techniques; cover cropping in no-till systems (with and without tarps for smothering); green mulches for soil moisture retention. ,,I'm really looking forward to working with team around some techniques on the farm.,"To sum:
1. Drawing more upon the knowledge and experience of farmers/creating more time for full group discussion. (Also, I think that to do this, there needs to be mandatory networking sessions so that everyone knows who's in the room.) 
2. Establish group guidelines for discussion and engagement that facilitate more equitable, robust, and productive conversation. 
3. Incorporate more diverse perspectives into the curriculum, especially voices of indigenous people and farmers of color.
4. Provide more adaptation techniques that don't involve plastic or more (fossil fuel) energy inputs.
5. Don't shift the entire approach of the fellowship, but also provide a perspective(s) on more systemic changes that might have to happen to on-farm systems and food systems in order to successfully adapt.

Prior to my opening the land in 2017, it had been in pasture for over 100 years and had not been amended since the existing dairy operation closed in the 1960s. Some of my primary management goals are to:
1. Improve the organic matter, fertility, nutrient-density, drainage, and water-retention of that soil. 
2. Prevent soil loss and retain topsoil when growing annuals, even on our 5-8% slope.
3. Prioritize climate-resilient crops and growing methods.
3a. Minimize tillage.
3b. Minimize plastic use.
3c. Choose varieties and crops based on their hardiness/minimize the inputs needed to bring plants to harvest.
4. Grow in ways that work with the character of the land and natural ecosystems—not against them. ","I am part of a community of farmers in the hilltowns of Western Mass (in the hills of Franklin, Hampshire, and Berkshire counties)that meet regularly and have a small listserv. We all have small farms (less than 20 acres) and grow with a different sensibility than larger operations in the valley and have been meeting for about a year and a half about a) how to best support each other and b) around the possibility of cooperative enterprise. These are the folks that I first consult for help when needed (Jen Salinetti at Woven Roots Farm, Dan Greene of Good Bunch Farm, Tevis and Rachel at Crapabble Farm, Lincoln and Hillary at Sawyer Farm). I also work regularly with CISA, specifically with Stevie Shafenacker, who has been working with my farm to develop a holistic management system (using HMI). My friend Connor Stedman, of Appleseed Permaculture, has also done some consulting work with the farm, specifically around water management and elderberry production. After that, I reach out to farm mentors and previous employers all around the county (Ned Conwell at Green Tractor Farm in New Mexico, Bob Sewall of Sewall Orchard in Maine, Ben Perault of Mountain View Farm in MA, and Austin Mandryk of Autelier Farm in Virginia). There is also a small community of farmers that I have never met but engage with on social media who are engaging more actively in questions of climate change and climate adaptation/resilience (Anthill Agroforestry, Whistledown Farm), and those are the people that I like to bounce ideas around with in terms of new crops/methods/resilience to climate change. And, of course, if I have questions about organic practices, I consult with Baystate, my certifier. ",,"A large part of what brought me to farming in my early twenties was a sense of urgency about our changing climate. At the time, I was working as a journalist at a nonprofit policy journal, and I was frustrated at how little it felt I could accomplish on the ""macro"" level in terms of addressing climate change, reforming food systems, working towards social justice etc. It felt like some of the most exciting and potent activism in the country was happening on small farms. In the last decade, I've tried to find a balance between the ""micro"" work of farming—sequestering carbon, land stewardship, local food access—and activism that more directly targets the causes of climate change—campaigns to stop pipelines, shut down coal plants, and encourage a green new deal. 

At this point in time, I feel somewhat hopeless that our political systems are going to do the work needed to mitigate carbon emissions and skeptical that we can effectively stop climate change. I have shifted my attention from ""fighting"" to ""adapting,"" basing my farming practice around questions like: ""How can we feed ourselves and each other in a changing climate?"" ""How can we grow in ways that mitigate climate change?"" ""Recognizing that plastic use is contributing to climate change and that global oil supplies may be increasingly unstable, how can we, as small farms, find ways to grow food without fossil fuels, including plastic?"" ""What and how can we grow for maximum ecological and social resilience?""  

More broadly: this season, I built an experimental 40-member CSA around these questions, inviting members to participate in an exploration of different crops, varieties, and wild edibles we might begin to incorporate into our culinary traditions. The foods in the CSA are selected for their high-nutrient value, healing qualities, and ability to withstand extreme weather conditions. The newsletter that accompanies this share is substantial, explaining as much about my process as a farmer exploring the above-mentioned questions as it educates about ways to cook and process the foods included. 

Getting to my point: climate adaptation is the bedrock of my farming practice and agricultural inquiry. However, despite all the mentors and peers that I named a few questions ago, only a small handful of those are engaging deeply with the question of climate change. Sometimes, I feel like everyone's conspiracy-theory-touting crazy uncle who keeps predicting the end of the world. I actually don't think that the world is ending, but I am hungry for a community of people and practice who start from the same assumptions and goals about climate change and what it will mean for the present and future of agriculture. 

I am hoping that participating as a fellow will present this kind of community of practice, allow me to considerably deepen my knowledge around best practices for plant and land resilience, and give me a stronger foundation in the current research. On a very specific level of management, I am particularly interested in exploring how to integrate more perennial fruits and nuts into the fields to compliment herb and vegetable production and how to better manage water systems to prepare for both drought and heavy rains. I'd like to deepen my knowledge around how the community of wild animals (including insects!) and plants around us contributes to or, possibly, detracts from the strength and adaptive potential of the farm.

And, more broadly, in the coming years, I'm interested in increasing the CSA— both in membership and offerings— and possibly even extending it to include other farms. I would certainly, at that point or at the point that the hilltown farmers increase our collaboration/cooperation, want to bring the skills and knowledge gained in the fellowship into these wider peer networks. 

In sum: I want to build on existing knowledge to create even stronger, more adaptive systems on my farm and while also working actively with other farmers and food system stakeholders (restaurants, coops, consumers) to build collaborative approaches to climate adaptation on a local and regional level. ","Climate change adaptation means a) accepting that climate is changing that this will affect agriculture significantly, b) preparing agricultural systems and farms for adverse climate events and conditions, including drought, heavy rains, and unpredictable seasons and temperatures, c) growing new crops and resilient/hardy varieties, d) resolving to feed our communities as our climate and seasons become increasingly unstable. 
Climate change is an integral part of both my management and outreach goals: I have been designing farm systems around resilience to climate change, and this goal is prominent in the outreach that I do through social media and the farm newsletters. In the outreach, I hope to prompt followers and readers to consider how agriculture has the potential both to contribute to and to mitigate climate change. It's my intention to, even if subtly, encourage them to change their consumer habits to support operations and enterprises that do the later.",Monthly,Monthly,Yearly,Monthly,Weekly,Weekly,Occasionally,Very knowledgeable about climate change,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat agree,Neutral,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat disagree,Strongly agree,"I understand that this fellowship is geared towards the management and production elements of agriculture, and that is my primary interest in participating.

My natural strengths lend themselves to looking at big picture visions and communicating those visions to others. This makes me very interested in the peer-to-peer outreach elements of being a fellow but it also makes it very likely that my outreach and education efforts will also extend to other local stakeholders in the food system, including chefs and consumers. I like to write (maybe that's apparent already from long-winded answers), and I love telling stories.

As a technical service provider, I hope to develop better communication skills regarding climate change in order to better serve the farming community and to learn new systems for adaption that incorporate all of a farms resources and not just those identified in production.  As a farmer, I hope to address some of the resource concerns we have through peer-to-peer learning and then to utilize our farm as an educational model to demonstrate climate adaptation practices that specifically relate to small-scale intensive vegetable production.   ","While I can't say it is pro-active, climate change adaption is identifying the impacts of more unexpected and severe changes in climate on the land and how we, as stewards, can develop and utilize best practices to manage current impacts as well as plan for what is being predicted for the future.  It is also about monitoring these changes so that they too can be adapted in order to fit the individual needs of each farm/forest.

Starting in December of 2019 I (Ben Crockett) was hired to manage the farming operations (as well as greenhouse operations at their Scarborough location) and grow food for group homes in the Morrison Center network. 2020 was the first year of food production, and the focus was on 1/4 acre of mixed vegetables, as well as maintaining hay fields. In the future their is strong demand to further develop food crops, with encouragement from Morrison management to plan and plant small fruit crops, an orchard, and other perennial crops(asparagus, herbs, etc.). The long term goal is to fully develop and utilize the 150 acres of the farm, which includes about 70 acres of hay land, and the rest in forest (currently developing a forestry management plan as well), to provide as much food for our clients and staff ""in house"". There is a great opportunity to make climate change a priority from the start, and make sure each enterprise and farm component contributes to a sustainable food source for The Morrison Center. With this fellows program I am hoping to develop cropping systems for weather resiliency, build data sets for future decision making, and share our model with similar organizations.","1) Text books/reference

I am also open to being paired with another farmer.",,,,,,,"I serve as the Education Director for the Northeast Organic Farming Association, Massachusetts Chapter (NOFA/Mass). NOFA/Mass and its parent / central organization NOFA have been advocating for and educating about ecologically sound farming since the 1970s, but our current approach to climate change and farming education began in 2011 when we invited former NOFA/Mass Education Events coordinator Eric Toensmeier to give the keynote address at our Summer Conference. In his keynote, he introduced (to many of us, for the first time) the idea that the carbon content of much of the world's agricultural land is significantly degraded, and that agricultural lands can sequester carbon to improve soil fertility and potentially mitigate climate change. NOFA/Mass quickly adopted this idea as a lens through which we viewed much of our work, and developed grants projects, publications, conference tracks, education events and a technical support methodology around the idea of building carbon in soils. 

My department now offers one-on-one ‘soil carbon proxy testing’ (on-site evaluation of soil health including evaluation of soil structure, infiltration rate, compaction, topsoil depth, bulk density and more), soil fertility amendment guidance, and cover crops technical support to about 40 farmers each year. We have a ‘Soil Health / Carbon Farming’ track at each of our two annual conferences (approx. 800 attendees each in non-pandemic years), two Soil Health Field Days (now online), webinars, podcasts and other on-farm events featuring healthy soils practices. In addition, I host a monthly ""Min Till Farmers Call"" (a simple farmer roundtable conference call) that is attended by farmers from all over the country, and currently manage three MDAR and NRCS funded multi-year farmer learning cohorts of growers. In this model, we collaborate with the growers to collect on-farm data on soil health and crop health outcomes, then meet regularly as a group to discuss the findings and how they relate to practices. We also use those outcomes to inform workshops on soil health and farming practices and encourage participating farmers to become educators in their networks.

Finally, I also work closely with our Policy Director Marty Dagoberto on our Healthy Soils policy work; NOFA/Mass has been a leading organization involved in drafting and organizing around the MA Healthy Soils Bill(S.438/H.873). Marty and I collaborate on outreach events, strategy and content related to this bill and I led the multi-agency committee that drafted the 2020 Budget Appropriations request that would have, if funded (prior to changing budget priorities due to coronavirus) established a Healthy Soils Agriculture Pilot Program in Massachusetts.  

My outreach goals are - and continue to be- to facilitate farmer-to-farmer, farmer-to-legislator, and farmer-to-consumer conversations about how farmers can lead on climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, I am most effective in my role when I can influence and infuse the conversation with resources that help the conversation keep evolving. If I keep learning and growing, I can better help move these conversations forward. ","NOFA/Mass is a grassroots, largely farmer-run organization. I have ten years of organic farming experience, and both our Executive Director and Board President are women who run commercial organic CSA farms alongside their NOFA commitments. Most of our board and staff are gardeners or farmers. While this gives us great depth of relationship with the organic farming community, we have very few academics and scientists in our organization. While I invest time in keeping up with the research on soil health and I do participate in working groups with researchers and academics (i.e. Open TEAM Field Methods working group, MA Healthy Soils Action Plan Advisory Team) l am especially interested in this Fellowship for the opportunity it affords me to receive training from, and interface with, Extension, academic researchers, and other agricultural advisors. I am sure there are gaps in my knowledge, and this program will help me identify and hopefully start to fill in those gaps. 

In addition, my focus in my work so far has been on soil health assessment and tillage reduction on organic farms. I have little exposure to conventional farming approaches to climate change resiliency. By participating in this program, I hope to develop a broader, more comprehensive view of agriculture and climate change. 
 ","To me, climate change adaptation in the context of agriculture primarily means two things:
1)	 Improving the health of agricultural and other managed soils so that they are better able to buffer moisture in the context of increasingly erratic precipitation (more frequent heavy rains and droughts) as well as to resist erosion and nutrient leeching. 
2)	Adapting individual and collective / network farmer knowledge of specific farm and land management practices that can protect land and crops from future increased risks of increased erosion, pests, and disease. (For example, beginning to address compaction and soil structure issues now, so that in several years water will infiltrate rather than run off, even if erosion isn’t a serious issue with current typical precipitation rates.)

It is central to the mission of NOFA/Mass to support the farming community in Massachusetts to be successful and effective so that more people have access to the ability to eat and grow nutritious food grown in living soils. Helping farmers adapt to climate change is critical to that mission as we move forward into this uncertain future.

Over the last few years we have had increasing soil moisture and temperature challenges.  
   I want to have enough water to be able to protect my strawberry crop from increasing late frosts with overhead irrigation.  I currently use row cover, which is high-cost in materials and labor and limits how much acreage I can plant.  Moreover, it has not been effective enough.  I also need more water pressure because I am not able to irrigate our fruit crops as much as they need, despite using drip irrigation.  I am for the first time considering overhead irrigation to start cover crops at the optimal time during drought.  I need to learn about my options for sourcing water (changes to well, pump from stream) and assess other water conserving horticultural techniques in the field(mulch types, planting dates, soil organic matter).
   I also need to explore costs and benefits of building a hoophouse over my raspberries.  The season before last I lost an entire year of production to winterkill when a late warm fall suddenly plunged into a cold snap and the winter ended on a roller coaster of thaws and freezes. A hoophouse would also allow us to use netting to exclude the novel pest Spotted Winged Drosophila from the raspberries.  However, I question compatibility of a hoophouse with you-pick marketing and I wonder about ROI.  ","   Climate change adaptation means changing horticultural practices to maintain or increase food production in the face of changing weather patterns.  It means understanding what trends to expect in the areas of temperature and precipitation and building systems that will be resilient and stable.  I also value the climate mitigation that building soils can provide.
  My goal is to produce a reliable crop year after year even if conditions are unfavorable.  I seek to have soil and crops so healthy that they mostly fend off new insects and diseases. I want to have healthy soil that can absorb heavy rainfall and can keep plants growing through a drought.  I want all my crops to have optimal water.  My current irrigation system cannot do enough.  Biodiversity provides stability and I aim to have a diverse farm, including insect diversity to provide pest protection and pollination.

I have a high tunnel at my office that I use/have used to conduct a variety of small scale research projects including variety trials, a soil fertility study, and winter production trials.  Most of the projects have been in collaboration with other professionals in NH, ME and VT.  My goal is to provide research based information to my clients in order to help them make the best decisions possible for their operations.  I work towards this goal using a combination of one on one education with farms, workshops, grower meetings, research projects, and online information resources.","Climate change generally and the year to year variation in weather conditions that are at least partially tied into climate change, represent a major challenge to farms.  They also raise a number of questions farmers need to be prepared to answer, and I'd like to be able to help.  

There will be new pests, and dealing with emerging pest issues no matter their cause always ties up farmer time and resources.  Examples in my area over my career include tomato hornworms, ticks, spotted wing drosophila, brown marmorated stinkbug, yellow rattle and japanese knotweed.  

If/when the current predictions play out there will be some crops we can grow that we couldn't before, and others we may need to let go of, or grow using new production methods.  

I have three specific questions I think this program might help me to explore.  First, how might climate change impact the availability of cost effective irrigation options that farmers in my area can use and still produce safe food. What should the priorities be in researching season extension practices to help farmers stay profitable in a changing climate.  And finally, FSMA is encouraging produce farms nationally to switch from manure to compost, but a great deal of nitrogen is lost in compost production, are there better options?

More generally I think this program could help me open dialogues with my clients about long term planning.  Currently, those conversations seem to center around expansion or contraction of the scope of the farm, updates to equipment and infrastructure, or exploring new markets.  Given what we know about climate change, should long term planning also be around other topics such as more protected culture, cover crops, and aggressive crop rotation?  Should we be talking more about plastics recycling and alternative energy? ","Climate change adaptation means predicting what might be coming and formulating a plan for how farms can adapt to the changes or even position themselves to thrive as the changes happen.  The bulk of my job is helping farms prepare for and address issues on their farms.

As a result of this workshop I am looking into alternate ways to use my vegetable field. Perhaps in an alley cropping scenario mixing trees and honeyberry with my vegetables. I am also going to try to get better educated about my irrigation. I need to learn when and how much irrigation to use. This past summer in the drought I just irrigated everyday - judged by the plants on which ones to water each day. I may also look into other agroforestry projects such as mushrooms.,,,"My hope is that any changes I make to my vegetable field will help me create a niche for myself in this area of Maine.

Living in Maine I appreciated the New England examples - I wondered how folks in the mid Atlantic region were relating to all of the New England examples?,I really need to go back and look at Art's presentation and the tools he presented. His argument makes sense. I only have two years experience as a market veg grower and in each year I had two very different scenarios when trying to plan for spring planting. The first year we had ice in our fields until mid April!!! Then a wet spring so I could not get in to work my field until late May - I had hoped to plant peas in late April - they got in the first week of June! An experienced farmer probably would not have planted peas that year. The second year (2020) ice was out much earlier but again a very wet spring and did not get into the field to plant until the end of May - our last frost date is around that time and I probably could have pushed it up to mid May. I might consider the GDD.,"Michel and Sara presented a lot of great ideas and I know that we should be able to implement some of them. The resources they provided will be very helpful. I think there is a hard balance between research and boots on the ground. In research everything is nuanced and translating that to a nuanced practice requires a lot of nimble thinking. For example, Michel was answering a question about types of tillage and whether carbon was released or sequestered and he was running through all of the variables that might create a different outcome in different practices. The discussion is interesting, however, when the farmer can't measure it the concept is lost on me. Having a science background I appreciate the nuances. I will just keep in mind what each of you said and do whatever makes sense within our land, labor, equipment capacity to do whatever we can to adapt and mitigate on the ground.","This was a very helpful session for me. I liken it to my primary career as a Registered Dietitian and counseling people, or giving talks on nutrition and health impacts. Knowing your audience and finding what might resonate with them to get their attention and meet them where they are, try to persuade them a little further is great information. I am so impressed with the tools developed to assist in this.

If I can indulge in a story about my farm. We wanted to get Scottish Highland cattle and sheep and use silvopasture. We are doing it the opposite of most people using this practice. We are doing it by reclaiming old sheep pasture rather than taking an open pasture and adding trees. So we did a big timber cut and curated the trees we wanted to leave in the pasture. We then started amending and seeding the land to support pasture grasses. We will continue to work on the grasses, we brought three heifers on the land and we started nut trees from seed that we will plant in the pasture. For the next few years we will be adding several hundred nut trees. As you can imagine our neighbors hated us, we were subject to harassment and mild vandalism. The harassment lasted over a year and a half. When the dead fish were thrown at the foot of our mailbox and lobster and crab shells strewn all over the driveway I had had enough and I wrote a letter to the editor of our local paper to explain what we are doing. Two things happened - we had a neighbor send in a letter to the editor bashing us and we had an outpouring of people in the town stop down, bring us gifts from their gardens and tell us that they liked what we were doing. Some immediate neighbors told us they never had sunlight come through their kitchen window before our cutting and they loved it. Another could never get grass to grow in his front lawn and liked the open view. Finally, one of our biggest detractors on land next to ours sent me an article about regenerative agriculture about six months later - the enclosed note said, ""this looks like what you are trying to do"". In addition to my letter to the editor, the newspaper came out and did a big article about us on New Year's Day 2020. He issued some facts but otherwise did an excellent job. We talked to everyone we met about what we were doing and the article helped people see that our intent wasn't to create environmental damage and that our silvopasture plan naturally incorporated mitigation plans. We had NRCS come and the state Soil Scientist as well as a pasture management expert from Cooperative Extension. So sorry for the long winded thread here, but my point was the communication aspect. Agritourism is one aspect of our farm plan and whenever we give people tours of the land I always talk about why I cover crop, why we are adding trees back into the pasture, why I leave a section of my field to milkweed, etc.","First, I think you did a great job designing this under the limitations imposed by the pandemic. And, I really hope that you can hold the workshop in person next time. I am not a shy person, but I am a recovering introvert so I do much better in small workshop settings. I have a really hard time jumping in to speak on Zoom. If I have expertise in a topic I have an easier time, but I am learning more that I am contributing here - I am expecting that to change by next January.


I am also probably one of your older participants and not used to trying to follow three or four conversations at once. It took me until Friday to realize that this just illustrated what a dynamic group this is and how important face to face is whenever we can return to that. I finally relaxed and told myself - all of the information and even the chat threads will be available to me and I can follow up with it.

Also, I am a beginner farmer and such a small producer I feel like I took so much more than I gave in the discussions. I do hope that our project will eventually be useful to small scale Maine farmers, and I hope we are successful in achieving climate adaptation results. 

I am sure it goes without saying that in-person is best and I did not reach out to providers or farmers in other areas of the Northeast - only my assigned service provider.

If you did this program again and we still had pandemic effects I wonder if a warm up winter project with say two to three teams might get more people engaged with each other? Drawing up a concept or case study? I don't know what that would look like.

We aim to inspire health and awareness by nourishing our community, stewarding our land and restoring heritage breeds. We believe that real food is essential to health and that how food is produced truly matters. Additionally we are committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of means, has access to our food. 
 
We raise vegetables, small fruits and pasture-raised pigs and heritage chickens and turkeys for meat and eggs on 13 acres in Lanesborough, Massachusetts in the heart of the Berkshires. We do all of this without the use of any pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, chemical fertilizer or GMO’s using methods that enhance the soil and nutrient density. Our growing practices exceed organic standards and we have been no-till for the last four years in order to preserve our soil structure and biology and to sequester carbon to mitigate climate change. Our intent is to work with nature to build a farm ecosystem that is resilient and provides diverse habitats for native species. 

Pasture-raised animals are integral to the vitality of our farm and we’re doing our part to preserve several heritage breeds. We breed, hatch and raise Buckeye and Australorp chickens and Standard Bronze turkeys, all of which are endangered according to the Livestock Breeds Conservancy. In addition, we raise several breeds of pigs. All our animals are reared on pasture using intensive rotational grazing principles and are humanely processed here on the farm. The quality of their care is our highest priority.

RSF strives to maintain as small a carbon footprint as possible. Solar panels on our barn provide the majority of our electricity. A “Climate Battery” heats one of our greenhouses through the fall and winter without fossil fuels. This innovative appropriate technology solution stores excess heat generated by the greenhouse in the summer and holds it in the ground beneath the greenhouse to be used on cold nights in the fall and throughout the winter.

To increase resiliency we have almost a quarter of an acre under cover including 3 high tunnels and two caterpillars. We also recently installed an irrigation system that is capable of watering all our growing spaces and supplies water to our animals on pasture. 

Education is a primary goal of RSF.  A public school educator for 30 years, I remain committed to teaching and learning. RSF is training the next generation of small farmers through its apprenticeship program in regenerative agriculture. We are also a host farm for Roots Rising, an amazing organization with a mission to empower disadvantaged youth and build community through food and farming. I lead farm tours, teach workshops and speak at conferences on regenerative agriculture topics. RSF is involved in grant-funded research studying the effects of regenerative farming methods on the intersection of soil health and food quality.
 
Red Shirt Farm is committed to ensuring food security to under-served and disadvantaged communities. RSF is SNAP-certified and provides fresh vegetables to two Berkshire County cities which struggle with poverty and food insecurity and have been particularly hard hit by the COVID crisis—Pittsfield and North Adams. 

In the coming years we plan to incorporate more edible perennials into our mix and create shelterbelts, native plant field borders, beetle banks and insectary strips.
","We are fortunate to be affiliated with a number of organizations which offer support and information to farmers. I have been a member of NOFA MA (Northeast Organic Farming Association) for decades and served on their Board. Their summer and winter conferences, workshops, farmer network and policy advocacy work have inspired our work and thinking. Berkshire Agricultural Ventures (BAV) provides us with technical support and financial assistance. The Bionutrient Food Association (BFA) and their annual Soil and Nutrition Conference has informed our approach to soil health, remineralization and nutrient density. NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) and MDAR (Massachusetts Department of Agriculture Resources) have provided consistent grant support and information. We get agronomy consulting from Advancing EcoAgriculture. We are members of Berkshire Grown, a local farmer support and advocacy organization which also provides an annual winter workshop series. For the past two years we have been one of six New England farms participating in a Conservation Innovation Grant which is studying the impact of growing practices, especially tillage reduction on soil health and nutrient density of crops, so that cohort and the researchers who are supporting us have been valuable assets. Growing Farmers and Kiss the Ground are two other groups which we turn to regularly for information. 

Of course, our peers in the farming community are also an invaluable resource, especially our Farmer Peer Mentoring group which meets monthly. Finally, our farm library is overflowing with books and periodicals. The Carbon Farming Solution, Call of the Reed Warbler and Kiss the Ground are currently on the nightstand and current issues of ACRES USA and Growing for Market are on the coffee table. Agriculture podcasts help us pass the time in the field. Now, more than ever, there is no shortage of information to help us farm better; only a shortage of time to absorb it all!
",,"Agriculture, as it has been practiced for the last 75 years,  is one of the largest contributors to climate change. However, regenerative agriculture has the potential to mitigate and possibly even reverse this catastrophic problem. As a farmer I feel that I have an obligation to know as much as possible about climate change and implement the practices that can sequester carbon and improve the health of the soil that we all depend upon. As a former high school science teacher I am fascinated by the research and the data and am compelled to share the information with whomever will listen whether that’s our apprentices, the high school group we work with, our CSA members or my fellow farmers.  

From a business perspective, I want to be prepared with strategies to cope with the inevitable weather challenges our farm will face. With the information I get from the CAF, I hope to build resiliency in our operation so that we can continue to offer food security to our community. For instance, on a granular level, I’d like to learn what species and varieties are best adapted to weather the climatic conditions we’ll be facing. 

I’m especially excited to work with Mark Phillips from Berkshire Agricultural Ventures as an advisor and to get to meet the other farmers who are participating in the program. Building a network of like-minded farmers and sharing information and ideas with those who are  living the same experience is perhaps the most compelling reason for applying to CAFP.

In particular, I hope to develop techniques and strategies to deal with extreme weather conditions including high winds, drought conditions interspersed with torrential rains and extended periods of high heat. I also seek to improve my communication skills to reach those who may not necessarily see the need for change. 
","Climate change adaptation requires that we first develop an understanding of the problem and realize that we are in the midst of an ever-changing situation. We need to adopt a resiliency mindset and a capacity to adapt to the challenges that will confront us as farmers. Clinging to the status quo and hoping for the best will not work. We must be willing to experiment with new strategies and actively communicate what works with our colleagues, our customers and with the community. Holistic, ecosystem-based approaches that incorporate Nature are an important part of the solution. Perhaps most importantly, adapting to climate change isn’t only about finding ways to continue growing our crops despite weather extremes, it’s about implementing practices that have the potential to mitigate and even reverse the climate catastrophe we have wrought.

One of these is our Climate Battery greenhouse which allows us to grow greens at a temperature of almost 40°F throughout much of the winter without the use of fossil fuels.

We spent too much time playing with the CO2 model.","I thought this was the most powerful session of the week.  Seeing this type of data is very compelling, especially when it can be broken down to specific locations for growers to see local data.  I would have liked to spend an entire session learning and talking about adaptation practices in a more in-depth way.  The subject of cover crops is familiar to all farmers, and theoretically they all would like to utilize cover crops.  But HOW to implement them is the real question.  I think the fellowship would be improved by more detailed and technical discussion of HOW to implement these strategies (which cover crops and when, what practices to use to increase SOM, equipement that can help organic growers reduce tillage)","These tools were fantastic, and I can imagine really using them with growers","I love Michel's research and I've read a lot of his work.  But in general, this session felt too academic.  Data was shown that half of ag energy use is diesel and fertilizer, so it would have made sense to focus on how to reduce use of those.  But then a lot of time was spent talking about energy conservation and using efficient lightbulbs, which doesn't feel like that's where the leverage is.  If this content was half of the session, and the second half was a farmer panel sharing their practices to reduce on farm energy and greenhouse gas output, that would be an improvement.  Also, there was a lot of interest in how to compost in a more climate-friendly way.  Bringing in an expert on that topic would be great!","I loved the Global Warming's Six Americas piece.

It seems really challenging to conduct this over Zoom, but you all did a great job.  Instructions were clear and the technology was flawless.  My main feedback is that the educational sessions were great to bring everyone up to speed.  But the practical and technical pieces were not in depth enough.  When I talk with farmers it's clear that they need help finding the right equipment to plant and terminate cover crops (and finance the equipement).  They already know that increasing soil organic matter is important, but implementing practices on individual farms is complicated and that's where they need technical support.

I work primarily on the eastern part of the state with farms of all kinds and sizes. I am an Agronomy Outreach professional and Certified Crop Advisor working in soil health and water quality. My primary clientele is dairy and crop farmers, to whom I provide one on one technical assistance and production support and also organize in field group workshops and winter farm to farm knowledge sharing group meetings. My educational and working background is with vegetable production and I have been fortunate to also partner with the UVM Veg and Berry team on vegetable farm visits, technical assistance, and provide content for commercial vegetable producer winter meeting series for the past two years focused on water quality, soil fertility and soil health. My outreach goals are to continue this work and continue to learn the practical, specific, and economically sound farm practice strategies for farms that support their resiliency in an ever challenging agricultural world.","Whether it is drought conditions or excessive moisture, and whether you call it climate change or not, weather extremes are impacting farms of all scales. Many farms are working hard within their resource capacity and abilities to make their business viable. I am interested in the Climate Adaptation Fellowship program because I would like to continue to improve my knowledge of the role that climate change plays in farm viability in order to best serve these farms as one of their trusted resources. The peer to peer learning between agricultural service provider and farmer, and the partnership building that forms trusting and deeper understandings of farm systems, is a key program offering by this Fellowship opportunity. There is a lot of literature and fact sheet based farm practice information out there, but I have found that by taking the time to closely work with key agricultural producers is the most insightful way of understanding opportunities and limitations of farm systems in relation to the practices promoted by agricultural service providers. I have also found that production practices proven on a commercial farm and the social capital of farmers themselves has great impact on farmer peers. One farm learning about and then successfully practicing no till and cover cropping eventually turns to multiple neighboring farms adopting the same practice. As part of this Fellowship, I would like to broaden my knowledge of research based climate adaptation and farm proven resiliency practices in order to offer additional tools for farms I work with so that they can choose what best serves their unique landscapes and goals. ","Climate change adaptation to me means recognizing the unique vulnerabilities of a farm landscape and business and finding ways to buffer the impact of weather extremes to those vulnerable areas. I think it can also mean taking radical steps towards creating diverse and creative business opportunities that may look different than what a farm has traditionally looked like in the past, but while also utilizing existing farm capital. One example I can think and that serves as inspiration is of a once large conventional dairy farm that left the milk production side of farming after years of depressed milk prices and facing the high cost of production that left them vulnerable in the event of crop failure. This farm has shifted to a more diversified farm operation that now includes no till/no spray small grain production, hemp, heifer boarding, perennial crop production (straw and hay), direct to consumer beef, and custom no-till cropping for neighboring farms.

One of UMass Extension’s Vegetable and Fruit teams’ primary models for educational delivery over the past decade has been our IPM mentor farm program. This grower-educator collaboration model allows individual producers to identify crop production and pest management goals for their own farms and to work directly with Extension personnel to develop strategies based on their own priorities, strengths, and resources. As an educator on the Vegetable Team since 2013, I have worked with farmers to develop whole-farm IPM plans that address particular issues, such as a specific insect pest, within the context of their broader farm and business decision-making. My role has been to visit and communicate with participating farmers regularly over the course of one to three seasons to advise on the plan and provide information about relevant research and technologies. Farms interested in trialing a novel practice may also serve as research and demonstration sites for Extension partner projects, and I have worked with growers to design and evaluate such projects, as well as to share the outcomes of their participation in the UMass program with their peers in on-farm twilight meetings and other outreach channels. In addition to working with growers through our IPM program, I developed a food safety education program at UMass to help vegetable and fruit producers understand state and federal food safety regulations and to develop practices for compliance. The goal of these outreach efforts is, broadly, to promote farming practices that sustain both the environment and the agricultural industry and to give farmers the tools to make decisions that are informed by sound science.","The growers I have spoken to and worked with recognize that climate change is happening. They have experienced prolonged drought, heavy storms, warmer winters—measurable impacts of the phenomenon on their own farms. The conversation around climate change, however, has tended to remain in the realm of the abstract. In recent meetings with the UMass Vegetable and Fruit teams’ grower advisory board, “climate change” broadly was identified as an important topic for future research and twilight meetings. My hope in participating in the Climate Adaptation Fellowship program is to be better able to connect what still may seem like a far-off threat to the realities of a farmer’s every day. Growers urgently need to adopt more efficient technologies and practices. They need better tools to respond to new and worsening pest problems and weather uncertainties. I hope to learn more and share about the tools already available to increase climate resilience and about the research gaps that need filling. 

Farmers and educators also need a richer understanding of the science of climate change and more facility with the language of that science to communicate it to our peers and link it to the realities we see on the ground. Ultimately, the US needs smarter climate-related policy and substantially more public funding for agricultural research. An informed and empowered citizenry, particularly of agricultural producers, is key to creating more responsive and effective farm policy. I hope through the fellowship to improve my ability to communicate with farmers, the general public, and other decision-makers about climate change and agricultural resilience. 
","Climate change adaptation involves adopting and increasing the use of practices that will help to reduce the variability and volatility caused by changing weather patterns and their many effects. It involves strategic planning based on good climate science to minimize the negative consequences of a changing climate and make use of the potential opportunities presented. My current outreach goals, related both to produce safety and pest management education, are to help farmers understand and weigh the risks to their operations and the tools available to manage them so that they can make informed decisions. Climate change affects these and all other aspects of farming (and society beyond that) and I plan to incorporate climate science and adaptation strategies into my existing educational materials. Within our UMass Extension teams, we also intend to explicitly include climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies as a key focus in upcoming grant proposals, in particular the proposal that funds our whole-farm integrated pest and crop management program, which is our primary vehicle for direct on-farm interactions with growers.

We are incorporating in-season and full season cover crops for erosion control, nitrogen fixation, improved organic matter, and general soil health. We are interested in learning more about how to increase carbon sequestration within a commercial vegetable operation; our business model inherently requires extraction of crops -and thus nutrients and carbon- from the soil.

learned has been through experience in the field (lots of trial and error), through working with other farmers, and through reading and researching on my own or at conferences, workshops, etc. The Climate Adaptation Fellowship seems like a unique opportunity for farmers to continue their education in a supportive setting. The opportunity to be paired with a service provider who will bring fresh eyes and a new perspective to my own operation is very appealing. Beyond the support that the fellowship offers, I'm eager to really hone in on how to build my farm's resilience in the face of climate threats. Since we started our farm six years ago, my business partners and I have worked to improve our practices from a soil health perspective, but it can be difficult to grasp how these practices are affecting our operation and our resilience. I'm very interested in the risk assessment and taking a deeper look at the financial implications of introducing new practices.","Climate change adaptation means building a stronger, more resilient business that will be able to withstand the impacts of climate change, and to continue to grow and thrive in the face of oncoming climate-related challenges. It means finding ways to grow food for our community through drought, hail storms, floods, and wet seasons. It means remaining a reliable source of food in the midst of crises - global pandemics, hurricanes, wildfires. It means building healthy soil, vibrant ecosystems and biodiversity on the 89 acres of land that we steward, with the intention of sharing the abundance and healthy products that come from this land with local families and vulnerable populations. Climate change adaptation will require an open mind, a willingness to take risks and try new things, and a commitment to finding the best systems for our scale, our local climate, and to meet the demands of our changing markets. Beyond our own farm, climate change adaptation means strengthening our local and regional food systems, so that people aren't relying on food produced and processed thousands of miles away and supply chains that are already riddled with weakness. Climate change adaptation means finding sustainable and regenerative methods for growing food - methods that don't extract and deplete our soils, but instead nourish and replenish it.

jamie@jonesfamilyfarms.com",3,<1,<1,~3,"I have been conducting research since 2010 that is providing methods that will allow Christmas tree growers to adapt to climate change. In particular, I have been a member of a consortium that has evaluated and found species of firs to be grown as Christmas trees that are drought and Phytophthora root rot tolerant, which protects against losses from the extreme variation we have been experiencing in rainfall.  My areas of expertise have also included management of small fruit pests (principally in strawberries and blueberries).  My participation will not be for my own farm's benefit, but to address the needs of the Jones Family Farm (https://www.jonesfamilyfarms.com/).  The Jones Family Farm is a large farm in Fairfield County with major plantings of strawberries, vineyards, blueberries, and pumpkins.  They are noted for their progressive agricultural practices, including (1) chemical mowing among Christmas trees, which provides diverse pollinator forage, which then benefits pollinators and the small fruit crops, (2) extensive use of cover crops and wood chip mulch for various crops for soil improvement and water conservation, and many other sustainable practices.  Jamie Jones wishes to participate along with me in the CAF Fellowship in order to develop strategies for the crops mentioned above that will allow his farm to continue being productive as increasingly challenging climate-related events add stress to their existing production system.  One notable example is pollination failure for certain varieties of pumpkins when air temperatures exceed 90 F during bloom.  
Participation of Jamie Jones with the CAF program is certain to have tremendous dividends for your program, as he is often called upon to speak to other vegetable and fruit growers in Connecticut, and he could be considered a bellwether grower in the state.","The Jones Family Farm usually goes to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station for advice, along with University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension (especially Mary Concklin, small fruit specialist), and Cornell University.  Both Jamie Jones and I are alumni of undergraduate degree programs in agricultural fields at Cornell University.","As a researcher at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, my job is ostensibly 100% research.  We are not part of a land grant institution, and cannot call our outreach ""extension.""  However, nearly all of my work involves diagnosing agricultural problems and conducting applied research to solve the problems faced by Connecticut farmers.  I am trained (B.S., M.S., Ph.D.) in entomology, but my title as Agricultural Scientist has allowed me to delve into additional aspects of crop research, with research trials, practical publications and lectures given on subjects including disease management (particularly phytophthora root rots), adapting to climate change (e.g., http://www.urbanforestrytoday.org/videos.html), optimizing use of fertilizer, mulching, and companion crops for pollinator, pest management and soil fertility benefits.  Up until the arrival of SARS-CoV2, I frequently provided lectures to the public, arborists, and fruit and vegetable growers on the subjects I listed above.  I often make field visits to farms to assist growers in identifying ways to improve their production - most frequently of Christmas trees, nurseries, and small fruits.  Although I have not worked in vegetable crops for 25 years, my doctoral work was on the subject of sustainable pest management in vegetable crops by designing  push-pull systems.  The theory I codeveloped with my advisor provided the basis for agricultural systems that has helped approximately 250,000 smallholder farmers in east Africa (see http://www.push-pull.net/).  My outreach goal in collaborating with Jamie Jones will be to identify methods to reduce crop production risk associated with climate change, test their practicality on his farm, and then extend these results to other growers through joint presentations, videos, or publications.","As I mentioned previously, I have been conducting research and giving presentations about climate change for the last 10 years.  I hope to be able to test and demonstrate methods at the Jones Family Farm for being able to adapt to difficult climate-related stressors.  I will personally learn from Jamie about crops (pumpkins and grapes) that I have not worked on previously, and devise with his help methods to address their farm's needs.  Successful methods can then be shared with other growers.","The impact of climate change on agriculture is not so much a matter of a change in the average temperature or precipitation as it is leading to wider variations in temperatures and precipitation patterns that our crops experience.  Adaptation becomes very difficult when we do not know whether crops will experience tremendous drought, flooding rains, prolonged high temperatures, or extended periods of cold temperatures.  Thus, finding approaches that can help protect against losses from all of these extremes will be a tremendous challenge.  Jamie has put if very well: ""I see the mitigation concepts being similar across many crops, and able to be applied in their own way to each one.  1. Genetics.  Selection of cultivars more tolerant to temperature and dry/wet variability.  2. Soils, improving organic matter, cover crops, mulching, drainage and irrigation.  3.  Pest management – new ones and old ones blowing up certain years due the extreme environmental conditions.  4.  Farm crop (revenue) diversification.

Our farm management goals are largely focused on improving soil health, reducing pest and disease pressure, increasing on-farm biodiversity, and creating climate-resilient systems. Our soils are heavy and clay-based, which are nutrient-rich but present drainage and compaction issues. We are working to address this through reduced-tillage practices, field design that maximizes drainage, soil coverage, and increased use of cover cropping. For the last two seasons we have used all of our acreage intensively, but will use the additional acreage to increase our cover cropping regime, with the aim of keep the soil covered, incorportating green manures, breaking up compaction, and reducing weed pressure. We aim to address pest and disease pressure by rotating crops, using physical barriers against pests, designing field and bed layout to maximize air flow, planting beneficial-attractant plants, and removing diseased or infested plants as necessary, in order to reduce or eliminate use of organic pesticides. As we go, we aim to further the climate resiliency of our farm through our soil management techniques, implementation of appropriate infrastructure, through gaining a greater understanding of weather-event preparedness, and through decreasing our reliance on off-farm inputs and fossil fuels.","We benefit heavily from MOFGA specialists and workshops, frequently reach out to Caleb Goossen, gain insight through the Maine Fruit and Vegetable email listserve and the MOFGA JourneyPerson Program, and frequently consult several mentor farmers.",,"We are interested in the program because we are constantly thinking about the impacts of climate change on the globe as a whole, and increasingly on the impacts to us as farmers in the coming decades. Agriculture is particularly affected by changes in weather patterns and temperature shifts, and yet is crucial to our survival as humans. We believe that small scale farms have a lot to offer our local communities, and yet need to be prepared for and resilient in the face of climate change. We are interested in learning to increase the climate resiliency of our farm through soil management techniques, implementation of appropriate infrastructure, gaining a greater understanding of weather-event preparedness, and through decreasing our reliance on off-farm inputs and fossil fuels. We are currently in a temporary lease, and are searching for a long-term farm property. Working with the heavy clay soils we have on our current farm has heightened our awareness of the complexitities involved in analyzing a potential property's soils for long-term success. We have experienced both droughts and heavy rain events on our current farm, and realize that there are pros and cons to every kind of soil. It is important to us to be able to determine the best possible starting block, and then to implement management practices that will benefit us most, with regards to soil and farm topography. It is also important for us to increase our self-reliance on the farm, as our farm, just like many others, is reliant on myriad systems to aquire nutrients, supplies, seed, soil, amendments, and fuels, any of which could fail due to climate change. We hope to reduce our need for some of these off-farm inputs, both because of the negative environmental impacts associated with some of these inputs, and because of the possibility that some of these may not be available to us in future.

","To us, climate change adaptation means having an awareness of how weather patterns and extreme weather events might affect our farm, having systems in place for mitigating the negative impacts of these on our income/markets/physical farm, building infrastructure that withstands climate change-related impacts and help us further our climate-resiliency goals, and being prepared for disease and pest changes that occur with a changing climate.
